# Development

## Dev Setup Requirements

This is a native OCaml project, so you will need the following tools:
- OCaml (we work on version 4.06.1 mostly, but other versions should work as well)
- dune >= 1.11.4

Easiest way to install these is via the [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) package manager. We don't use `esy` for simplicity reasons.

```
# Create / switch to ocaml 4.06.1
opam switch create 4.06.1

# Install deps
opam install dune.1.11.4 --yes
```

After that, install some npm dependencies as well:

```
npm install
```

## Build genType

```
# Builds the project
npm run build

# Alternatively
dune build
```

When the compilation went through successfully, you'll now find the executable in `_build/default/src/GenType.exe`.
Running the executable:

```
_build/default/src/GenType.exe --version
```

## Test genType

Make sure to always run the tests before submitting any changes (CI usually takes
longer to give you feedback).

```
npm test
```

## Releases (for Maintainers)

The project is compatible with the [`npm
version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) workflow. After using the `npm
version [major|minor|patch|...]` command, npm will automatically tag the
current commit, bump all the necessary version numbers (also the number in
`src/Version.ml`) and push it to the current remote branch.

When a tag is pushed, proceed to manually create a release from that tag using the GitHub website. (To be automated later).

**Here are the concrete commands to run:**

```
# Make sure to commit & push all current changes, the working branch should be clean
# and synced up with your remote branch

# Also make sure that your current branch is explicitly set to the relevant remote
# (`git push` instead of `git push origin master`)
git status

# For patches (0.0.X+1)
npm version patch

# For minor (0.X+1.0)
npm version minor

# For major (X+1.0.0)
npm version major
```

## Releasing to npm (Maintainers only)

Use the GitHub web iterface to download the artifact `gentype-npm.tar`.

```
# Dry run for testing
npm publish gentype-npm.tar --dry-run

# Publish package as @latest
npm publish gentype-npm.tar

# Publish package with @beta tag
npm publish gentype-npm.tar --tag beta
```

Consult the [npm publish](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish) documentation for more options.
In case you get an `ENEEDAUTH` error, use `npm adduser` and authenticate with your npm account first.
