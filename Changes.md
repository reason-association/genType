# master
- Make genType.importStrictLocal only affect the specific import, not the whole file.

# 0.27.0
- Fix issue where pulling in types from files in other directories was not working.
- Add support for annotation @genType.importStrictLocal to generate strict-local Flow files.

# 0.26.0
- Support importing types with type parameters.
- Prevent imported values from being used directly from JS.

# 0.25.0
- Remove deprecated CLI option `—setProjectRoot`.
- Support `@genType.as "name"` to rename how labeled arguments in functions are exported. Works for function definitions and function types declarations. In parcticular, the `make` function for components. In case of function definitions, the first argument can't be renamed because of a compiler bug. [See this issue](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/75).

# 0.24.0
- Improved debug output and number of options, and made controllable from bsconfig.json.
- Fixed issue with import strings containig `.\directory` on Windows.
- Extended support for signatures and module types.
- Module include is supported for Type Expansion.
- First-orer modules are supported for Type Expansion.
- Functor application supported for Type Expansion.
- Annotating a type means all the types mentioned in it are also considered annotated. (Implemented via Type Expansion).
- Add support for type expansion [See this issue](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/70)

# 0.23.0
- Clean up terminology used in README.md. Following the cleanup plan on import/export in https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/70.
- Implement principle 1: an imported type is also exported to other modules.
- Support tuple types.
- In Flow, keep opaque types also opaque internally, so export erros are caught early like in TS.
- Fix: Type names for types which are defined somewhere are not considered opaque.
- Fix: no conversion generated for opaque types.
- Generated code can be in a different order, because of refactoring how type declarations are processed.

# 0.22.0
- Support the case where the `make` function of an exported Reason component could be curried.
- Support `ImmutableArray.t` type for convesion to `ReadonlyArray` in TS/Flow.
- Add library for immutable arrays.
- Fix missing handling of `@genType.opaque`.
- Allow importing types from within nested modules.
- Allow a combination of `@genType.import` and `@genType.as` to specify an imported type.
- Object and record fields are now mapped to readonly propeties, unless they're mutable.

# 0.21.0
- Support nested components. So it's possible to define several components in one file.
- Support for recursive types. If a recursive type requires a conversion, only a shallow one is performed, and a warning comment is emitted.
- Update README describing how genType works in both directions.

# 0.20.0
- Add support for Enum types.

# 0.19.0

- [Remove deprecated way of wrapping JS components](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/commit/9c388826c43eb9507b07fd95a05eed3ce619297d).
- [Use strict imports for wrapping JS values and components](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/commit/81c6a7f062c87c141b734dd1bb338faf1afc8f5a).
- [Generate opaque types corresponding to an existing Flow/TS type](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/63).

# 0.18.0
- Move "gentypeconfig" inside bsconfig.json. Using a file gentypeconfig.json is deprecated.
- Remove support for deprecated @genFlow annotation, and genflowconfig.json file.

# 0.17.0
- [Experimental feature: Typed wrappers for JS values](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/pull/60).
- [Add full support for wrapping JS component, and examples](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/commit/50b8e87c0e8942b0de2620f9d24ba7baceb07067).

# 0.16.0
- Support type Js.nullable in addition to Js.Nullable.t.
- Fix import name compare which can lead to missing type imports with the same name from diffent files.
- Add missing conversion from float to number.
- Add initial shim for Js.Array.t.
- Js.Null_undefined.t and Js.null_undefined are the same as nullable.
- Array types are not opaque.
- Shims for Obj.
- New format form shims: {"fromModuleName": "toModuleName"}.
- Cleaner generated output, with some basic pretty-printing heuristics.
- Generate TS code compatible with --strictPropertyInitialization.

# 0.14.0
